  
## To Do
- [X] split train data to 80,20% ( we make the 20% our test data since we have no access to the test-data from kaggle)
- [X]  run the inception  on every image 
- [X]  save the 2048 vector for each image in some format 
- [X]  from the biz(business) feature vector as a mean vector of all the images related to the biz. (DANIEL ON IT)
- [X]  finally, run a classifier (SVM or random-forest) on the biz feature vectors  (TEE & ABI)
- [ ]  use the test data to evaluate   (TEE & ABI)
- [ ]  write a draft of the report (Ashwary)
- [ ]  prepare presentation slides (Ashwary)
- [ ]  Use tensorboard and previous experiment results to get presentation/poster valuabl graphs, showwing the ability of assigning labels to independent images.
